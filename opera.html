    <h3>CHORUS OF NOBLES-—Courtyard of Ko-Ko's Palace in Titipu.  Japanese nobles
        discovered standing and sitting in attitudes suggested by
        native drawings</h3>
        <p class="song"> If you want to know who we are,
          We are gentlemen of Japan:
     On many a vase and jar—
          On many a screen and fan,
               We figure in lively paint:
               Our attitude's queer and quaint—
               You're wrong if you think it ain't, oh!

     If you think we are worked by strings,
          Like a Japanese marionette,
     You don't understand these things:
          It is simply Court etiquette.
               Perhaps you suppose this throng
               Can't keep it up all day long?
               If that's your idea, you're wrong, oh!</p>
               <h5 class="PISH">PISH</h5><P class="speech">And what may be your business with Yum-Yum?</P>
               <h5 class="NANK">NANK</h5><p class="speech"> But how good of you</p> <p1 class="directions">(for I see that you are a
                    nobleman of the highest rank)</p1> <p class="speech">to condescend to tell all this to
                    me, a mere strolling minstrel!</p>
               <h5 class="POOH">POOH</h5><p class="speech"> The fact appears to be as you've recited:
                         But here he comes, equipped as suits his station;
                         He'll give you any further information.</p>
               <h5 class="KO">KO</h5><p class="speech">Exactly—as the city will have to pay for it.  That is
                    your advice.</p>  
               <h5 class="YUM">YUM</h5><p class="speech"> Well, of course I know nothing about these things; but
                    I've no objection if it's usual.</p> 
               <h5 class="PITTI">PITTI</h5> <P class="speech"> Oh, I expect it's all right.  Must have a beginning,
                    you know.</P> 
               <h5 class="PEEP">PEEP</h5><P1 CLASS="directions">(who has been examining Pooh-Bah).</P1><P class="speech">  I beg your pardon,
                    but what is this?  Customer come to try on?</P>
