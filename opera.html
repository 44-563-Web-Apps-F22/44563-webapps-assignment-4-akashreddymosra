     <h3>ACT-I:Courtyard of Ko-Ko's Palace in Titipu. Japanese nobles
          discovered standing and sitting in attitudes suggested by
          native drawings</h3>

     <p class="song">
          If you want to know who we are,
          We are gentlemen of Japan:
          On many a vase and jar—
          On many a screen and fan,
          We figure in lively paint:
          Our attitude's queer and quaint—
          You're wrong if you think it ain't, oh!

          If you think we are worked by strings,
          Like a Japanese marionette,
          You don't understand these things:
          It is simply Court etiquette.
          Perhaps you suppose this throng
          Can't keep it up all day long?
          If that's your idea, you're wrong, oh!

     <p class="speech"> The fact appears to be as you've recited:

          He'll give you any further information.</p>

     <h5 class="YUM"><span>YUM</span> </h5>
     <p class="speech"> Well, of course I know nothing about these things; but
          I've no objection if it's usual.</p>
